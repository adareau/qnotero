## What is Qnotero?

Qnotero provides lightning quick access to your Zotero references. Zotero is an excellent open source reference manager, but it lacks a simple and direct way to access your references at the click of a button. That is why I created this simple program, which lives in the system tray and allows you to search through your references by Author and/ or Year of Publication. If a PDF file is attached to a reference you can open it directly from within Qnotero.

Freely available under the [GNU GPL 3](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html).

## Dependencies

- [PyQt5] -- Pass `--qt4` as command-line argument for PyQt4 support.

## Gnote integration (Linux only)

If you have Gnote installed (a note-taking program for Linux), Qnotero automatically searches Gnote for a (section in a) note belonging to a specific article. Qnotero expects each note to be preceded by a bold line containing at least the name of the first author and the year of publication within parentheses, like so:

    Duhamel et al. (1992) Science 255
